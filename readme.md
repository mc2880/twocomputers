<h1>History</h1>

I was asked to make a box for an upcoming tour that could keep two QLab computers in sync by pressing the same key simultaneously on two computers.

This project is just a recent build of an old idea that was mentioned about 3 years ago and I helped prototype but never had  finished project. This isn't the only way to accomplish this task, but it works. 
  <h1> Bill Of Materials </h1>

Below is a list of the materials I used for the project. It's not the only setup that will work, it is accurate to what I used. I did not include enclosure and labeling. I picked up a small hammond box locally and laser cut the lamicoid to suit, your project will probably take a different form.

  <h1>Schematic</h1>
  
  I used the stacking headers to make a pair of Teensy 3.2s that will simultaniously respdond to button inputs.
